can you think of  logic if question is not found in the database then it should return a list of question he can answer but the list of question should have same meaning question dont give code explain the logic how we can achieve this in dotnet 6

2 / 2

ChatGPT
Certainly! To implement a logic that returns a list of questions with similar meaning when the requested question is not found in the database, you can follow these steps:

Use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) Library:
Integrate an NLP library like SpaCy, NLTK, or any other suitable library for your .NET application. These libraries can help you analyze the meaning of the input question.

Define a Similarity Threshold:
Set a similarity threshold that determines how closely the input question needs to match with the existing questions in the database. This threshold will help filter out questions with significantly different meanings.

Calculate Question Similarity:
When a user requests a question, use the NLP library to calculate the similarity between the input question and each question in the database. Most NLP libraries provide functions to calculate the similarity between two text strings.

Filter Similar Questions:
Filter out questions from the database that have a similarity score above the defined threshold. These questions are considered similar in meaning to the user's input.

Return Similar Questions:
If there are similar questions in the database, return this list to the user. If not, you can then return a default response or inform the user that there are no similar questions available.

Here's a conceptual example using an NLP library (such as SpaCy) and assuming the existence of a function CalculateSimilarity to calculate similarity:

Copy code

using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using SpaCyDotNet;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace Chat_bot_with_react.Controllers
{

    public class AdminCalcoController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly AppDbContext _dbContext;

        public AdminCalcoController(AppDbContext dbContext)
        {
            _dbContext = dbContext;
        }

        [HttpGet("questions")]
        public IActionResult GetCalcoQuestions([FromQuery] string userQuestion)
        {
            var allQuestions = _dbContext.CalcoQuestionAnswersTables.ToList();

            // Use a natural language processing library to calculate similarity
            var similarQuestions = GetSimilarQuestions(userQuestion, allQuestions);

            if (similarQuestions.Any())
            {
                return Ok(similarQuestions);
            }
            else
            {
                // Provide a default response or inform the user that there are no similar questions
                return Ok(new { Message = "No similar questions found. Please ask a different question." });
            }
        }

        private IEnumerable<CalcoQuestionAnswers> GetSimilarQuestions(string userQuestion, List<CalcoQuestionAnswers> allQuestions)
        {
            var similarQuestions = new List<CalcoQuestionAnswers>();
            var similarityThreshold = 0.7; // Set your desired threshold

            foreach (var question in allQuestions)
            {
                // Calculate similarity between the user's question and each question in the database
                var similarityScore = CalculateSimilarity(userQuestion, question.MainQuestion);

                // Check if the similarity score is above the threshold
                if (similarityScore >= similarityThreshold)
                {
                    similarQuestions.Add(question);
                }
            }

            return similarQuestions;
        }

        private double CalculateSimilarity(string userQuestion, string databaseQuestion)
        {
            // Use an NLP library function to calculate similarity
            return SpaCy.DotNet.Similarity(userQuestion, databaseQuestion);
        }
    }
}
Please note that the CalculateSimilarity function is a conceptual representation, and you should replace it with the actual implementation based on the NLP library you choose. Also, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed for the chosen NLP library.

User
anyother way

Certainly! Another approach, without relying on an external NLP library, is to use a simpler method based on keyword matching and string similarity. Here's a revised example using the Levenshtein distance for string similarity and basic keyword matching:

csharp
Copy code
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace Chat_bot_with_react.Controllers

        public AdminCalcoController(AppDbContext dbContext)
        {
            _dbContext = dbContext;
        }

        [HttpGet("questions")]
        public IActionResult GetCalcoQuestions([FromQuery] string userQuestion)
        {
            var allQuestions = _dbContext.CalcoQuestionAnswersTables.ToList();

            // Use Levenshtein distance for string similarity
            var similarQuestions = GetSimilarQuestions(userQuestion, allQuestions);

            if (similarQuestions.Any())
            {
                return Ok(similarQuestions);
            }
            else
            {
                // Provide a default response or inform the user that there are no similar questions
                return Ok(new { Message = "No similar questions found. Please ask a different question." });
            }
        }

        private IEnumerable<CalcoQuestionAnswers> GetSimilarQuestions(string userQuestion, List<CalcoQuestionAnswers> allQuestions)
        {
            var similarQuestions = new List<CalcoQuestionAnswers>();
            var similarityThreshold = 0.5; // Set your desired threshold

            foreach (var question in allQuestions)
            {
                // Check if the user's question contains keywords from the database question
                if (ContainsKeywords(userQuestion, question.MainQuestion))
                {
                    // Calculate Levenshtein distance for string similarity
                    var distance = LevenshteinDistance(userQuestion.ToLower(), question.MainQuestion.ToLower());

                    // Normalize distance to a similarity score (1 - normalizedDistance)
                    var similarityScore = 1.0 - (distance / Math.Max(userQuestion.Length, question.MainQuestion.Length));

                    // Check if the similarity score is above the threshold
                    if (similarityScore >= similarityThreshold)
                    {
                        similarQuestions.Add(question);
                    }
                }
            }

            return similarQuestions;
        }

        private bool ContainsKeywords(string userQuestion, string databaseQuestion)
        {
            // Check if the user's question contains any keywords from the database question
            var keywords = databaseQuestion.Split(' '); // Split database question into keywords
            return keywords.Any(keyword => userQuestion.ToLower().Contains(keyword.ToLower()));
        }

        private int LevenshteinDistance(string s, string t)
        {
            var n = s.Length;
            var m = t.Length;
            var d = new int[n + 1, m + 1];

            for (var i = 0; i <= n; i++)
            {
                for (var j = 0; j <= m; j++)
                {
                    if (i == 0)
                    {
                        d[i, j] = j;
                    }
                    else if (j == 0)
                    {
                        d[i, j] = i;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        d[i, j] = Math.Min(Math.Min(d[i - 1, j] + 1, d[i, j - 1] + 1), d[i - 1, j - 1] + (s[i - 1] == t[j - 1] ? 0 : 1));
                    }
                }
            }

            return d[n, m];
        }
    }
}
This approach is less complex than using an NLP library but may be less accurate. Adjust the similarityThreshold and consider refining the keyword matching based on your specific use case.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

If you have any more questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss, feel free to let me know!



------------------

**You:**

what did my previous input about

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Your previous input included a code snippet for a .NET Core controller in C# that handles CRUD operations for a set of questions and answers related to a chat bot. Additionally, you asked for guidance on implementing logic to return a list of questions with similar meanings if the requested question is not found in the database. We discussed two approaches: one using an NLP library for more sophisticated similarity calculation, and the other using a simpler method based on keyword matching and Levenshtein distance for string similarity. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or clarify further?



------------------

**You:**

list of questions with similar meanings if the requested question is not found in the database
can you explain that approach Levenshtein distance for string similarity.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! The Levenshtein distance, also known as the edit distance, is a measure of the similarity between two strings. It calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.

In the context of finding similar questions, we use the Levenshtein distance to measure how different the user's input question is from each question in the database. The idea is that questions with lower Levenshtein distance are more similar.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in the Levenshtein distance approach:


- **Define the Levenshtein Distance Function:**
   - The Levenshtein distance function takes two strings, let's say `s` and `t`, as input.
   - It creates a matrix of size `(len(s) + 1) x (len(t) + 1)` to store intermediate edit distances.
- **Initialize the Matrix:**
   - The first row and first column of the matrix represent empty strings to the respective lengths.
   - Initialize the matrix with values corresponding to the length of the string at each position.
- **Calculate Edit Distances:**
   - Iterate through each cell of the matrix, starting from `(1, 1)`.
   - Update each cell based on the minimum of three possible operations:
      - Insertion: `matrix[i, j-1] + 1`
      - Deletion: `matrix[i-1, j] + 1`
      - Substitution: `matrix[i-1, j-1] + (s[i-1] == t[j-1] ? 0 : 1)`
   - **Retrieve the Final Edit Distance:**
   - The bottom-right cell of the matrix (`matrix[len(s), len(t)]`) contains the Levenshtein distance between the two strings.
- **Normalize Distance to Similarity Score:**
   - To convert the distance to a similarity score, normalize it by dividing by the maximum length of the two strings (`Math.Max(len(s), len(t))`).
   - Subtract the normalized distance from 1 to get a similarity score between 0 and 1.
- **Set a Similarity Threshold:**
   - Choose a similarity threshold (e.g., 0.5) to determine whether two strings are similar enough.
- **Filter Similar Questions:**
   - For each question in the database, calculate the Levenshtein distance and check if the similarity score is above the threshold.
   - If it is, consider the question as similar.
- **Return Similar Questions:**
   - Return the list of questions that passed the similarity threshold as the result.

This approach provides a basic way to measure similarity based on the number of edits needed to transform one string into another. Keep in mind that it may not capture semantic similarity as effectively as more advanced NLP techniques but can still be effective for simple cases. Adjust the similarity threshold based on your specific use case and the desired level of sensitivity to similarity.



------------------

**You:**

is there any other way in dotnet 6

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

In .NET 6, you can leverage the improvements and features available in the framework to enhance the way you handle similarity between questions. While the core concept of measuring similarity remains the same, you can explore additional libraries and techniques. Here are a couple of suggestions:


- **Use a Text Matching Library:**
   - In .NET 6, you can explore third-party text matching libraries that offer advanced similarity measurement techniques. One such library is the [SimMetrics](https://github.com/tonybaloney/SimMetrics) library.
   - SimMetrics provides various algorithms for string similarity, including Jaccard, Jaro-Winkler, Smith-Waterman, etc. These algorithms may offer more nuanced measures of similarity compared to Levenshtein distance.
- **Explore ML.NET for Semantic Similarity:**
   - ML.NET is a machine learning framework for .NET developers. In .NET 6, you can explore using ML.NET to build a model for semantic similarity between questions.
   - Train a model using a dataset of question pairs labeled with their similarity. The model can then predict the similarity score between new question pairs.
   - This approach can potentially capture semantic similarity more accurately than traditional string distance metrics.

Here's a high-level overview of using ML.NET for semantic similarity:

// Install the ML.NET NuGet package
// Install-Package Microsoft.ML

using Microsoft.ML;

public class QuestionPair
{
    public string Question1 { get; set; }
    public string Question2 { get; set; }
    public bool SimilarityLabel { get; set; }
}

public class SimilarityPrediction
{
    [ColumnName("PredictedLabel")]
    public bool SimilarityPredictionLabel { get; set; }
}

// Train the model
var context = new MLContext();
var data = LoadTrainingData(); // Load your labeled dataset

var pipeline = context.Transforms.Conversion.MapValueToKey("Label")
    .Append(context.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText("Features", "Question1", "Question2"))
    .Append(context.Transforms.Conversion.MapKeyToValue("Label"))
    .Append(context.BinaryClassification.Trainers.SdcaNonCalibrated())
    .Append(context.Transforms.Conversion.MapValueToKey("PredictedLabel"))
    .Append(context.Transforms.Conversion.MapKeyToValue("PredictedLabel"));

var model = pipeline.Fit(data);

// Use the trained model to predict similarity
var predictionEngine = context.Model.CreatePredictionEngine<QuestionPair, SimilarityPrediction>(model);

var userQuestion = "User's input question";
var databaseQuestions = LoadDatabaseQuestions(); // Load your database questions

var similarQuestions = databaseQuestions
    .Select(dbQuestion => new QuestionPair { Question1 = userQuestion, Question2 = dbQuestion })
    .Select(pair => predictionEngine.Predict(pair))
    .Where(prediction => prediction.SimilarityPredictionLabel)
    .ToList();

```
Keep in mind that using ML.NET involves training a model with labeled data, and the effectiveness of the model depends on the quality and representativeness of your training dataset.

Choose the approach that best fits your requirements and the complexity of similarity measurement needed for your chat bot.



------------------

**You:**

third-party text matching libraries
do we have  any free library

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, there are several free and open-source text matching libraries available for .NET. One such library is the **SimMetrics** library, which provides various algorithms for string similarity. It's easy to use and can be integrated into your .NET project.

Here's how you can use SimMetrics in your .NET project:


- **Install the SimMetrics NuGet Package:**

```bash
Copy code
Install-Package SimMetrics

```

```csharp
Copy code
using SimMetricsMetricUtilities;
using SimMetricsUtilities;

public class SimilarityCalculator
{
    public double CalculateSimilarity(string str1, string str2)
    {
        // Choose a similarity algorithm, for example, Jaccard
        AbstractStringMetric metric = new Jaccard();

        // Calculate the similarity
        return metric.GetSimilarity(str1, str2);
    }
}

```
You can replace `Jaccard` with other algorithms provided by SimMetrics, such as Jaro, Jaro-Winkler, Cosine Similarity, and more.

**You:**

Levenshtein distance any other algorithm

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! While Levenshtein distance is a popular algorithm for measuring the similarity between two strings, there are several other algorithms that you can consider based on your specific use case. Here are a few alternatives:


- **Jaccard Similarity:**
   - Measures the similarity between two sets by calculating the intersection divided by the union of the sets. It's often used for comparing the similarity of two documents or sets of words.
- **Jaro-Winkler Distance:**
   - An extension of the Jaro distance algorithm that gives more weight to common prefixes. It's commonly used for comparing short strings like names.
- **Cosine Similarity:**
   - Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, often used in natural language processing for comparing documents or text.
- **Hamming Distance:**
   - Calculates the minimum number of substitutions needed to change one string into the other of equal length. It's suitable for strings of the same length.
- **Dice Coefficient:**
   - Measures the similarity between two sets by calculating twice the intersection divided by the sum of the sizes of the sets. It's similar to Jaccard similarity.
- **Smith-Waterman Algorithm:**
   - A local sequence alignment algorithm that finds the optimal local alignment between two strings. It's useful for identifying similar substrings within longer strings.
- **N-gram Similarity:**
   - Involves breaking down strings into sequences of n characters (or words) and comparing the presence and frequency of these n-grams in the strings.
- **Sørensen-Dice Coefficient:**
   - Similar to Dice coefficient, measuring the similarity between two sets by calculating twice the intersection divided by the sum of the sizes of the sets.

The choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of your strings and the type of similarity you're looking to measure. For example, Jaccard similarity is often used for document comparison, Jaro-Winkler for string matching with a focus on prefixes, and Cosine similarity for text analysis.

You can experiment with different algorithms and choose the one that best fits your particular use case and requirements.

**You:**

what if i compare the char in the string to a number and compare based on that number

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

If you're considering comparing characters in a string based on their numeric representation, you could use the ASCII values of the characters for comparison. Each character in a string has a corresponding ASCII value, and you can leverage these values to create a simple numeric representation for comparison.

Here's a basic example using C# where you sum up the ASCII values of characters in two strings:

```csharp<button class="flex gap-1 items-center"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon-sm"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M12 4C10.8954 4 10 4.89543 10 6H14C14 4.89543 13.1046 4 12 4ZM8.53513 4C9.22675 2.8044 10.5194 2 12 2C13.4806 2 14.7733 2.8044 15.4649 4H17C18.6569 4 20 5.34315 20 7V19C20 20.6569 18.6569 22 17 22H7C5.34315 22 4 20.6569 4 19V7C4 5.34315 5.34315 4 7 4H8.53513ZM8 6H7C6.44772 6 6 6.44772 6 7V19C6 19.5523 6.44772 20 7 20H17C17.5523 20 18 19.5523 18 19V7C18 6.44772 17.5523 6 17 6H16C16 7.10457 15.1046 8 14 8H10C8.89543 8 8 7.10457 8 6Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>Copy code</button>
public class CharacterComparison
{
    public static int CompareStrings(string str1, string str2)
    {
        int sum1 = GetAsciiSum(str1);
        int sum2 = GetAsciiSum(str2);

        return Math.Abs(sum1 - sum2);
    }

    private static int GetAsciiSum(string str)
    {
        return str.Sum(c => (int)c);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string string1 = "hello";
        string string2 = "hola";

        int result = CharacterComparison.CompareStrings(string1, string2);

        Console.WriteLine($"Comparison result: {result}");
    }
}

```
In this example, `GetAsciiSum` calculates the sum of ASCII values for characters in a string, and `CompareStrings` computes the absolute difference between the sums of ASCII values for two strings. This simplistic approach gives you a numeric representation of the "difference" between two strings based on their characters.

Keep in mind that this method doesn't necessarily capture semantic similarity and might not be as effective as more advanced string similarity algorithms for certain use cases. It's a basic approach that you can consider depending on the nature of your strings and the desired comparison results. If you need a more nuanced similarity measurement, algorithms like Levenshtein distance, Jaccard similarity, or others mentioned earlier might be more suitable.



------------------

**You:**

what do you call this approach how accurate it will be

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

This approach of comparing strings based on the sum of ASCII values is a simplistic form of string comparison, and it doesn't have a specific name. You could refer to it as "character-based ASCII sum comparison" or something similar.

The accuracy of this approach depends on the nature of the strings you're comparing and the specific requirements of your use case. Here are some considerations:

**Advantages:**


- **Simplicity:** This method is straightforward and easy to implement.
- **Speed:** It can be computationally faster than more complex algorithms.

**Limitations:**


- **Lack of Semantic Understanding:** It doesn't capture the semantic meaning of words or phrases. Two strings with different meanings may have similar ASCII sums.
- **Sensitivity to Character Order:** It treats all characters equally and is sensitive to the order of characters. Reordering the characters in a string may significantly change the comparison result.
- **Limited to ASCII Characters:** It's specific to ASCII characters and may not handle non-ASCII characters or special symbols well.

**Accuracy:**
The accuracy of this approach is limited, and it may not be suitable for applications where a more nuanced understanding of similarity is required. For tasks such as comparing words or phrases in natural language, more advanced algorithms like Levenshtein distance, Jaccard similarity, or cosine similarity are often more accurate.

If precision in similarity measurement is critical for your use case, consider using dedicated string similarity algorithms that are designed to handle the complexities of natural language and semantic understanding. The accuracy of those algorithms is generally higher in capturing the similarity of strings in a more meaningful way.

what can you do to make it better

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

To improve the simplistic "character-based ASCII sum comparison" approach, you can consider incorporating more sophisticated techniques that capture semantic and contextual information. Here are some suggestions:


- **Use Tokenization:**
   - Rather than comparing entire strings, tokenize the strings into words or sub-sequences. Compare the ASCII sums of individual tokens. This helps in capturing similarities at a more granular level.
- **Normalize Case and Remove Punctuation:**
   - Normalize the case of the characters (e.g., convert all characters to lowercase) to ensure case insensitivity. Additionally, remove punctuation to focus on the alphanumeric content.
- **Weighted Character Comparison:**
   - Assign weights to characters based on their relevance or importance. For example, you might give higher weights to vowels or certain consonants. This can help prioritize specific characters in the comparison.
- **Consider Unicode or Extended ASCII:**
   - If your application involves non-ASCII characters or special symbols, consider using Unicode or extended ASCII values for a more comprehensive character set.
- **Use a Hybrid Approach:**
   - Combine the ASCII sum comparison with other algorithms. For instance, you can calculate both the Levenshtein distance and the ASCII sum difference and weigh the results based on the specific requirements of your use case.
- **Explore Word Embeddings:**
   - Utilize pre-trained word embeddings or train your own embeddings using machine learning models. Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words and can provide a more nuanced understanding of similarity.
- **Consider Phonetic Matching:**
   - Explore phonetic algorithms such as Soundex or Metaphone to account for phonetic similarity. This can be useful for comparing strings that sound similar.
- **Implement Fuzzy Matching Algorithms:**
   - Explore fuzzy matching algorithms like the Jaro-Winkler distance or cosine similarity. These algorithms consider partial matching and are more resilient to minor differences.
- **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Train a machine learning model using a labeled dataset for similarity. This approach can learn patterns in your specific domain and provide more accurate results.
- **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Implement a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the model based on user interactions and feedback.

Remember, the choice of improvement depends on the specific characteristics of your strings and the goals of your application. Experimenting with different techniques and measuring their effectiveness in your specific use case will help you find the most suitable approach.

**You:**

what if i want to consider charter counting

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

If you want to consider character counting as a factor in your string comparison, you can incorporate it into your comparison algorithm. Here are a few ways to enhance your approach by considering character counts:

### 1. **Normalized Character Counts:**

- Instead of directly summing ASCII values, normalize the character counts by dividing them by the total number of characters in the string. This way, you get a ratio or percentage of each character's contribution to the overall content.

### 2. **Weighted Character Counts:**

- Assign different weights to characters based on their importance. For example, you might assign higher weights to vowels, certain consonants, or specific characters that are more relevant in your context.

### 3. **Character Frequency Distribution:**

- Analyze the frequency distribution of characters in each string. Compare the distributions rather than just the raw counts. This can provide insights into the overall composition of characters in each string.

### 4. **Consider n-grams:**

- Instead of individual characters, consider character n-grams (sequences of n characters). This can capture more complex patterns and relationships between characters.

### 5. **Character Co-occurrence:**

- Examine the co-occurrence of characters in each string. This involves analyzing which characters frequently appear together. For example, you might create a matrix showing how often each pair of characters appears together.

### 6. **Jaccard Similarity of Character Sets:**

- Treat the set of characters in each string as a set and use Jaccard similarity to measure the similarity between the character sets. This approach is useful for capturing common characters across the strings.

### 7. **Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**

- If you have a collection of strings, you can apply TF-IDF to give higher weight to characters that are unique or distinctive within a specific string but not common across the entire collection.

### 8. **Character Matching with Tolerance:**

- Instead of exact matching, consider allowing for a tolerance level when comparing characters. This can be useful when dealing with minor variations or errors in character representation.

### 9. **Machine Learning Models:**

- Train a machine learning model using features derived from character counts. This could involve using a labeled dataset to predict similarity based on character count-related features.

### 10. **Feedback and Iterative Improvement:**

- Implement a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the model based on user interactions and feedback.

Experiment with these approaches and determine which one aligns best with the characteristics and requirements of your specific use case. Depending on the nature of your strings and the goals of your application, different variations of character counting and weighting may provide more accurate results.

**ChatGPT:**

It looks like you have implemented a simple chatbot interface using React. If you want to render buttons in the chatbot for users to interact with, you can modify your `ChatBubble` component to include buttons.

Here's a modified version of your `ChatBubble` component that supports rendering buttons:

```jsx<button class="flex gap-1 items-center"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon-sm"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M12 4C10.8954 4 10 4.89543 10 6H14C14 4.89543 13.1046 4 12 4ZM8.53513 4C9.22675 2.8044 10.5194 2 12 2C13.4806 2 14.7733 2.8044 15.4649 4H17C18.6569 4 20 5.34315 20 7V19C20 20.6569 18.6569 22 17 22H7C5.34315 22 4 20.6569 4 19V7C4 5.34315 5.34315 4 7 4H8.53513ZM8 6H7C6.44772 6 6 6.44772 6 7V19C6 19.5523 6.44772 20 7 20H17C17.5523 20 18 19.5523 18 19V7C18 6.44772 17.5523 6 17 6H16C16 7.10457 15.1046 8 14 8H10C8.89543 8 8 7.10457 8 6Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>Copy code</button>
import React from 'react';
import { FaUser, FaRobot } from 'react-icons/fa';

function ChatBubble({ sender, message, buttons, onButtonClick }) {
    const isUser = sender === 'user';

    const renderButtons = () => {
        if (buttons &amp;&amp; buttons.length > 0) {
            return (
                <div className="mt-2 flex space-x-2">
                    {buttons.map((button, index) => (
                        <button
                            key={index}
                            className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-md"
                            onClick={() => onButtonClick(button)}
                        >
                            {button}
                        </button>
                    ))}
                </div>
            );
        }
        return null;
    };

    if (isUser) {
        return (
            <div className="flex justify-end self-end mb-4">
                <div className="flex items-center justify-end">
                    <div className={`p-2 max-w-[83%]  bg-green-500  text-white rounded-md self-end`}>
                        <p className='break-words'>{message}</p>
                        {renderButtons()}
                    </div>
                    <FaUser className="ml-2" />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    } else {
        return (
            <div className="flex justify-start mb-4">
                <div className="flex items-center">
                    <FaRobot className="mr-2" />
                    <div className={`p-2 max-w-[83%]  bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-md self-start`}>
                        <p className='break-words'>{message}</p>
                        {renderButtons()}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default ChatBubble;

```
In this modified version, the `buttons` prop is an array of button labels, and the `onButtonClick` prop is a callback function that gets triggered when a button is clicked. The `renderButtons` function generates the button elements based on the provided buttons array.

Now, when you use the `ChatBubble` component, you can pass an array of buttons along with the `message`. For example:

```jsx<button class="flex gap-1 items-center"><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon-sm"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M12 4C10.8954 4 10 4.89543 10 6H14C14 4.89543 13.1046 4 12 4ZM8.53513 4C9.22675 2.8044 10.5194 2 12 2C13.4806 2 14.7733 2.8044 15.4649 4H17C18.6569 4 20 5.34315 20 7V19C20 20.6569 18.6569 22 17 22H7C5.34315 22 4 20.6569 4 19V7C4 5.34315 5.34315 4 7 4H8.53513ZM8 6H7C6.44772 6 6 6.44772 6 7V19C6 19.5523 6.44772 20 7 20H17C17.5523 20 18 19.5523 18 19V7C18 6.44772 17.5523 6 17 6H16C16 7.10457 15.1046 8 14 8H10C8.89543 8 8 7.10457 8 6Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>Copy code</button>
<ChatBubble
    sender="bot"
    message="How can I assist you?"
    buttons={['Option 1', 'Option 2']}
    onButtonClick={(button) => console.log(`Button clicked: ${button}`)}
/>

```
This will render a bot message with the specified buttons, and clicking a button will trigger the `onButtonClick` callback. Adjust the styles and button functionality as needed for your specific use case.
