React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces or UI components. It is widely used for creating single-page applications where UI changes dynamically based on user interactions. React follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to build encapsulated and reusable UI components.

Component-Based: React applications are built using components. Each component represents a part of the user interface and can contain its own logic and state.
